# Word-guess-Cli
This does not work. I followed a tutorial -- didn't work. I studied and compared code -- didn't work. I have spent hours on this. And while it doesn't work. I tried to get practice and learn -- so I'm handing it in anyway.

Here's the tutorial I used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnSgRvmTJA4

I know the constructors work. I can get a radom word selected. But, I cannot get the program to take in user guesses and process them in any way. Maybe I'll have my tutor go through it with me.
